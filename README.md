What did you build? I built tetris since its one of my favorite games
What language(s) or tools did you use? I used javascript and html
Which AI tools did you use, and how? I used cursor ai which helped me alot when i couldnt figure something out as it guided me in the right direction.
What did you do versus what AI helped with? I did a good amount of the css in the html file and also the JS functions in the same file, the ai helped me alot with the divs it used and also making the tetrominos which was difficult.
What’s one thing you’re proud of? How I was able to get ai to do something I wanted I thought I would end up explaing it wrong and get stuck at that point and not get the final product I wanted.
What’s one thing you’d improve with more time? Id try to decide on a game i want to make eaerlier and definelty be more creative in adding more things to the game.
